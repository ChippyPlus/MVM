## Future Enhancements for MVM

This document outlines potential future enhancements and improvements for the Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) project.

### 1. Extended Instruction Set

* **Floating-Point Operations:** Add instructions to support floating-point arithmetic.
* **String Manipulation:** Introduce more advanced string manipulation instructions (e.g., substring operations, string
  searching).
* **Array Operations:** Add instructions for working with arrays (e.g., array creation, indexing, element access).

### 2. Advanced Memory Management

* **Dynamic Allocation:** Introduce an `ALLOC` instruction to enable programs to dynamically request memory blocks.
* **Memory Manager:** Implement a memory manager to handle dynamic allocation, deallocation, and memory compaction (
  garbage collection) to reduce fragmentation.
* **Memory Protection?:** Explore adding memory protection mechanisms to isolate programs from each other, enhancing
  security and stability.

### 3. Multitasking

* **Process Management:** Add support for running multiple programs concurrently.
* **Scheduler:** Implement a scheduler to manage the execution of multiple processes (e.g., round-robin scheduling,
  priority-based scheduling).
* **Inter-Process Communication:** Provide mechanisms for processes to communicate with each other.

### 4. Virtual Devices

* **Networking:** Implement a virtual network interface to allow programs within the VM to communicate over a network.
* **File System:** Create a virtual file system for persistent data storage.

### 5. Debugging and Tooling

* **Debugger:** Implement a debugger that allows developers to step through program execution, set breakpoints, inspect
  memory, and examine registers.
* **Assembler:** Develop a more advanced assembler with support for macros, labels, and other features.
* **Profiler:** Create a profiler to measure the performance of programs running on the VM.

### 6. Performance Optimisation

* **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Explore using JIT compilation to convert frequently executed bytecode into native
  machine code for faster execution.
* **Instruction Optimisation:** Analyse and optimise frequently used instructions for better performance.

### 7. Advanced Language Features

*Maybe not this one so much

* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Consider adding support for object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes,
  objects, and methods.
* **Higher-Level Language:** You could design a higher-level language that compiles to MVM bytecode.

### Conclusion

The future of MVM is full of exciting possibilities! These enhancements would significantly increase the VM's power,
flexibility, and usefulness as a platform for education, experimentation, and even practical applications. Let me know
if you have any other questions.
