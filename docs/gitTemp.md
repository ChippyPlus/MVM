# Future Enhancements

This page outlines potential future enhancements and features for the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) project. These
enhancements are categorized to provide a roadmap for the VM's evolution.

## Core VM Improvements

1. **Variable-Sized Memory:** Implement dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, allowing programs to request and
   release memory as needed. This would require new system calls (e.g., `malloc`, `free`) and potentially a garbage
   collector.
2. **Garbage Collection:** Explore different garbage collection algorithms (mark-and-sweep, reference counting) to
   manage memory automatically and prevent memory leaks.
3. **Enhanced Instruction Set:** Add more instructions to support more complex operations and data types directly in the
   assembly language.
4. **Floating-Point Support:** Introduce floating-point data types and instructions for floating-point arithmetic.
5. **Exception Handling:** Implement a more sophisticated exception handling mechanism (beyond just terminating the
   program). This could involve exception handlers, try-catch blocks, or other error recovery strategies.
6. **Multithreading:** Add support for multiple threads of execution within the VM. This would be a significant
   architectural change.
7. **Interrupts:** Implement interrupt handling, allowing the VM to respond to external events or signals.
8. **Virtual Memory:** Implement virtual memory to give programs the illusion of a larger address space than physically
   available.  (Advanced)
9. **Security Features:** Explore sandboxing and other security mechanisms to restrict the actions of MVM programs.
10. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Explore JIT compilation to translate frequently executed bytecode into native
	machine code for improved performance.
11. **Hardware Support:** Add instructions to interface with real hardware.

## Data Structures and Types

12. **Native Array Support:** Implement native array types with bounds checking and built-in array operations (length,
	access, modification) directly in the VM.
13. **Other Data Structures:** Add support for data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, and
	trees. This might involve new instructions or standard library functions.
14. **User-Defined Types:** Allow users to define their own data structures or record types (like structs in C).
15. **Object-Oriented Features (Long-term):** Consider if and how to add basic object-oriented features (classes,
	objects, methods) to MVM assembly language.

## Standard Library Enhancements

16. **Modular Standard Library:** Organize the standard library into well-defined modules (string, math, I/O, etc.) with
	clear interfaces.
17. **More String Functions:** Implement more advanced string functions, such as regular expression matching,
	formatting, and character encoding/decoding.
18. **Expanded Math Library:** Add more mathematical functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.) especially if
	floating-point support is added.
19. **I/O Improvements:** Provide buffered I/O and formatted output functions.
20. **Networking Support:** Add system calls and standard library functions for network communication (sockets).
21. **Date/Time Functions:** Provide functions for working with dates and times.

## Tooling and Development

22. **Improved Debugger:** Enhance the debugger with features like breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection, and stack
	tracing.
23. **Assembler:** Create a more sophisticated assembler with support for macros, symbolic constants, and better error
	reporting.

## Language Features

24. **Improved Syntax:** Explore alternative syntaxes for MVM assembly to make it more readable and user-friendly.
25. **Type Checking:** Implement basic type checking to catch type errors at compile time.
26. **Scoping and Namespaces:** Add support for scoping and namespaces to better organise code and prevent naming
	conflicts.

## Performance and Optimization

## Performance and Optimization

Optimizing the MVM involves improvements to both the VM's execution engine and the assembly code itself. Here are some
key areas of focus:

27. **Bytecode Optimization:**
	* **Dead Code Elimination:** Remove instructions that have no effect on the program's output.
	* **Constant Folding:** Evaluate constant expressions at compile time to reduce runtime overhead.  (e.g., replace
	  `LIT G1 5`, `LIT G2 10`, `ADD G1 G2` with `LIT G3 15`)
	* **Common Subexpression Elimination:** Avoid redundant calculations by reusing the results of previously computed
	  expressions.
	* **Instruction Reordering:** Rearrange instructions to minimize memory access or improve pipeline efficiency (if
	  applicable to your VM's design).
	* **Peephole Optimization:**  Apply local optimizations to small sequences of instructions (e.g., replacing
	  inefficient combinations of instructions with more efficient equivalents).

28. **Register Allocation:**
	* **Efficient Register Usage:**  Develop algorithms or strategies to minimize register spills (where values have to
	  be moved to memory because there aren't enough registers). This is more relevant as you introduce more registers.
	* **Register Coloring (Advanced):** A graph-coloring algorithm can be used to assign variables to registers
	  optimally.

29. **Stack Management:**
	* **Stack Frame Optimization:**  Minimize the size of stack frames (used for function calls) to reduce memory usage
	  and improve stack access times.
	* **Stack Allocation (Advanced):**  If possible, explore allocating some variables directly on the stack instead of
	  in memory.

30. **Memory Access Optimization:**
	* **Caching (If Applicable):**  If your VM's memory model allows it, implement caching to speed up access to
	  frequently used memory locations.
	* **Memory Locality:** Encourage better memory locality in generated code (e.g., by keeping related data close
	  together in memory) to minimize cache misses.

31. **System Call Optimization:**
	* **Minimize System Calls:**  System calls are often expensive. Reduce the number of system calls by buffering I/O
	  or performing operations in the VM whenever possible.
	* **Batching (Advanced):** Combine multiple related system calls into a single call to reduce overhead (if the host
	  operating system supports it).

32. **Profiling and Benchmarking:**
	* **Performance Profiling:**  Develop tools to profile the execution of MVM programs to identify performance
	  bottlenecks.
	* **Benchmarks:** Create a suite of benchmark programs to measure the performance impact of VM optimizations and
	  track improvements over time.

34. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:**
	* **Native Code Generation:** Explore AOT compilation to translate MVM bytecode directly into native machine code
	  for the target platform, bypassing the bytecode execution engine entirely for potentially significant performance
	  gains.

## Other

35. **Bytecode Verification:** Add bytecode verification to ensure that loaded programs are well-formed and safe to
	execute. (Important for security)
36. **Cross-Compilation:** Explore the possibility of cross-compiling MVM bytecode to other platforms.
37. **Standard Test Suite:** Develop a standardized test suite for the VM and its standard library to ensure correctness
	and prevent regressions as the VM evolves.

This list is not exhaustive but provides a comprehensive set of goals for the future of MVM. The focus should remain on
educational value and simplicity, even as more advanced features are added.
