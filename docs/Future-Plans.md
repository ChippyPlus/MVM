# Plans & Enhancements

## I. Language and Runtime Enhancements

1. **Customizable Syntax:** Allow users to define their own syntax for MVM assembly language, enabling domain-specific
   languages or personalized coding styles.
2. **Built-in Data Structures:** Implement built-in support for more complex data structures like hash maps, trees, and
   graphs, accessible through standard library functions or new instructions.
3. **Type Inference:** Add type inference to your higher-level language (if you create one), reducing the need for
   explicit type declarations.
4. **Automatic Memory Management:**  Explore garbage collection algorithms (mark-and-sweep, reference counting) to
   automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.
5. **Reflection API:** Allow programs running in the VM to inspect and manipulate their own structure and behavior (
   e.g., access register values, inspect the call stack).
6. **Dynamic Linking:** Enable dynamic linking of libraries or modules, allowing programs to load and use external code
   at runtime.

## II. Virtualisation and System-Level Features

7. **Nested Virtualisation:** Allow running a VM *inside* your MVM!  (Requires careful resource management).
8. **Hardware Emulation (Beyond Simple Devices):** Emulate more complex hardware, like a simplified GPU, sound card, or
   network card with packet routing capabilities.
9. **Virtual Machine Introspection:** Provide tools or system calls that allow VM programs to inspect and modify the
   VM's state.
10. **Snapshots and Checkpointing:** Enable saving and restoring the complete VM state or creating checkpoints during
	program execution for debugging and fault tolerance.
11. **Process Migration:** Allow migrating running processes between different instances of your MVM (if you have
	multiple VMs running).
12. **System Call Sandboxing:** Implement security mechanisms to restrict system call access for untrusted programs.

## III. Concurrency and Parallelism

13. **User-Level Threads:** Implement user-level threads within the VM, managed by a user-space thread library.
14. **Multicore Support:** Extend the VM to support multiple emulated cores, enabling true parallelism.  (Requires a
	more sophisticated scheduler.)
15. **Asynchronous I/O:** Implement asynchronous I/O operations for virtual devices, allowing processes to continue
	execution while waiting for I/O to complete.
16. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Instructions:** Add SIMD instructions to perform parallel operations on
	vectors of data.

## IV. Debugging and Development Tools

17. **Time-Travel Debugging:** Implement a debugger that allows stepping backward through program execution to analyze
	program behavior.
18. **Code Coverage Analysis:** Add tools to measure code coverage during testing.
19. **Performance Profiler:** Develop tools to profile CPU usage, memory access patterns, and other performance metrics.
20. **Bytecode Disassembler:** Create a tool to disassemble MVM bytecode back into assembly language for easier
	analysis.

## V. Advanced VM Features

21. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Compile frequently executed bytecode into native machine code for performance
	gains (challenging, as it's architecture-specific).
22. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler:** Compile MVM bytecode into native executables for specific platforms.
23. **Garbage Collection:** Implement garbage collection algorithms to automate memory management.
24. **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Allow MVM programs to call functions written in other languages (e.g., C/C++).
25. **Bytecode Verification:** Add bytecode verification to ensure that loaded programs are well-formed and don't
	violate security policies.

## VI. Random Ideas

26. **Non-Deterministic Execution:** Implement instructions with probabilistic outcomes, creating a non-deterministic
	execution environment (interesting for simulations or genetic algorithms).
27. **MVM as a Service:** Create a web service that allows users to upload and run MVM programs remotely.

This document details planned enhancements for the MVM. This is a high-level view, and the prioritization and specifics
are subject to change.
