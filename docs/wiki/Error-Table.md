# Error Table

One again yes its hard to fully read.

| Error Number | Error Type                          | Description                                                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | InvalidRegisterException            | An invalid register type was used in an instruction.                                 | This might occur if you try to use a system register (`S1`-`S4`) in an arithmetic operation.                                             |
| 2            | InvalidMemoryAddressException       | An attempt was made to access memory outside the defined bounds.                     | Ensure that memory addresses used in `LOAD`, `STORE`, and string instructions are within the allocated memory range.                     |
| 3            | InvalidInstructionException         | An unknown or unsupported instruction was encountered.                               | Double-check the instruction mnemonics in your assembly code for typos or unsupported commands.                                          |
| 4            | InvalidSystemCallException          | An invalid system call number was used.                                              | Refer to the system call table for the correct system call numbers supported by the VM.                                                  |
| 5            | StackOverflowException              | The stack reached its maximum capacity (overflowed).                                 | This typically indicates excessive or recursive function calls or an attempt to push too many values onto the stack.                     |
| 6            | EmptyStackException                 | An attempt was made to pop from an empty stack.                                      | Check for mismatched `PUSH` and `POP` instructions or attempts to `POP` without pushing any values.                                      |
| 7            | GeneralArithmeticException          | A general arithmetic error occurred during an operation (e.g., division by zero).    | The most common cause is dividing by zero. Review your arithmetic operations and data values.                                            |
| 8            | SystemCallGeneralException          | A general error occurred during a system call execution.                             | This is a more generic error for system call failures. The specific reason might vary (e.g., file not found, permission issues).         |
| 9            | FileAccessException                 | An error occurred while trying to access a file (e.g., file not found, permissions). | Make sure the file exists, the path is correct, and the VM has the necessary permissions.                                                | 
| 10           | SocketException                     | An error occurred related to network sockets.                                        | This usually indicates problems with network communication. Check network settings and connectivity.                                     |
| 11           | MemoryAllocationException           | An error occurred during memory allocation (e.g., insufficient memory).              | This error suggests the VM is running out of memory. You may need to increase the allocated memory or optimize your code.                |
| 12           | InvalidInstructionArgumentException | An instruction was provided with an invalid argument.                                | Verify that arguments for instructions (like register names, memory addresses, or literal values) are valid and in the correct format.   |
| 13           | NullRegisterException               | An attempt was made to read from an uninitialized register (null value).             | Initialize registers with values before using them in operations.                                                                        |
| 14           | NullAddressException                | An attempt was made to access a memory address that is null.                         | Ensure that registers holding memory addresses have been properly initialized before being used in `LOAD` or `STORE`.                    |
| 15           | InvalidFileDescriptorException      | An invalid file descriptor was used in a file operation.                             | Make sure file descriptors are obtained from successful `openFile` system calls and are not closed prematurely.                          |
| 16           | NotFreeMemoryException              | An attempt was made to write to a memory address that is already in use.             | This often occurs in string operations. Check for overlapping memory regions when writing strings or data.                               |
| 17           | GeneralBitwiseException             | A general error occurred during a bitwise operation.                                 | This is a broader category for bitwise operation errors. The specific cause needs to be diagnosed further.                               |
| 18           | GeneralControlFlowException         | A general error occurred related to control flow instructions (JMP, JZ, JNZ).        | Review your jump instructions and ensure that target addresses are valid and within the program's code.                                  |
| 19           | GeneralDataTransferException        | A general error occurred during data transfer operations (MOV, CPY, LIT).            | This category covers errors during data movement between registers and memory. Investigate the specific instruction causing the problem. |
| 20           | GeneralIoAbstractionsException      | A general error occurred during input/output operations.                             | This error relates to issues beyond file access, such as problems with console output.                                                   |
| 21           | GeneralMemoryException              | A general error occurred during memory operations (LOAD, STORE).                     | Investigate memory access patterns and addresses to identify the cause of the error.                                                     |
| 22           | GeneralStackOperationsException     | A general error occurred during stack operations (PUSH, POP, PEEK).                  | Review `PUSH`, `POP`, and `PEEK` instructions for potential errors, such as stack overflows or underflows.                               |
| 23           | GeneralStringException              | A general error occurred during string operations.                                   | This broad category covers errors specific to string instructions.  Look for issues with string lengths, null terminators, etc.          |
