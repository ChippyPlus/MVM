# MVM System Call Implementation

This document details how system calls are implemented in the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine). System calls provide a
mechanism for user-space programs to request services from the kernel.

## System Call Interface

User programs invoke system calls using the `syscall` instruction. The system call ID is passed in register `S1`.
Arguments are passed in registers `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`. The result (if any) is stored in `R2` by the system call
handler.

## System Call Handling

The system call mechanism involves:

1. **`syscall` Instruction:** A user program executes the `syscall` instruction.

2. **Trap:** The VM's execution engine detects the `syscall` instruction. This triggers a trap or interrupt, switching
   execution to kernel mode.

3. **System Call Handler (`SystemCallHandler.kt`):** The system call handler:
	- Retrieves the system call ID from register `S1`.
	- Retrieves any arguments passed by the user program from registers `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`.
	- Calls the appropriate kernel function to handle the system call. This is handled in the `SystemCall.execute`
	  function which uses a `when` statement to call the correct function.
	- Stores the return values (if any) in `R2`.

4. **Return to User Mode:** Once the system call is handled, execution returns to the user program.

## Example: `readFile` System Call

Let's trace the steps for `readFile`:

1. **User Program:** A user program calls `readFile` using the `syscall` instruction:
   ```assembly
   lit S1 2         		// System call ID for readFile	
   str S2 "file name.txt"	// Address of the filename string
   syscall             		// Make system call
   printr R2           		// Retrieve the result (address of data) 
   ```

2. **Trap:** The `syscall` instruction causes a trap to the kernel.

3. **System Call Handler:**
	- The system call handler in `SystemCallHandler.kt` detects the system call ID (`2`).
	- It calls the `readFile` function in `internals.systemCalls.calls.readFile.kt`, passing the filename address (
	  `filename_address`) from register `S2`.

4. **`readFile` Function (`internals.systemCalls.calls.readFile.kt`):**

  ```kotlin
  fun SystemCall.readFile(nameX: RegisterType) = call("readFile") {
      val name = helpers.readRegisterString(nameX)
      val out = (vm.vfs.read(name) ?: errors.FileNotFoundException(name)) as String
      val spot = helpers.writeClosestString(out)
      registers.write(RegisterType.R2, spot)
  }
  ```

- This function interacts with the virtual file system (`vm.vfs`) to read the file's content.
- The function then uses the `writeClosestString` helper function to copy the data into memory.
- The function places the address of the data (from the VFS) on the stack.

5. **Return to User Mode:** The system call handler returns control to the user program. The user program can then
   access the data from the address stored in `R2`.

## Key Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Each system call function should implement robust error handling, returning error codes or raising
  exceptions. The system call handler should manage these errors appropriately.
* **Concurrency:** You'll need to ensure that system calls are handled concurrently if you have multiple processes
  running. Synchronisation mechanisms might be needed if a system call involves shared resources.
* **Kernel Design:** The design of your kernel (in `os/OS.kt`) determines how efficient and robust system calls are.
* **Documentation:** Clearly document each system call, its arguments, return values, and potential error conditions in
  your System Call Table and the associated documentation.

This detailed explanation clarifies the system call implementation in the MVM.
The system call handler is a central point where user programs interact with the kernel.
It's a key element in the design of your virtual machine.
Each system call is responsible for managing any necessary resources,
interacting with virtual devices, and performing necessary actions.
Return values are always stored on the stack, which is managed by the VM's runtime environment.

# Informational Register Table

These registers hold status information and flags. They are not directly manipulated by most instructions, but
instructions may set their values based on the result of an operation.

## Notes

- **Resetting Flags:** Many flags are automatically reset after an operation that might modify them. This prevents the
  flags from interfering with later operations.
- **Error Handling:** `I6` (ENSF) and `I7` (ESF) are essential parts of your error handling mechanism. Use them to
  indicate that an error has occurred. You can check their values to perform fault handling in the program.

# MVM Data Types

The Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) supports several fundamental data types. These types are used in instructions, system
calls, and within the standard library functions. The MVM uses a 64-bit architecture, but some instructions and
functions can operate on smaller data types as specified by the `SETTYPE` instruction. All values are stored in memory
as 64-bit Longs unless otherwise specified. The data type stored in the registers is tracked by using the `RegisterData`
class which you can change at any time using the `SETTYPE` instruction. If an instruction or system call that operates
on a smaller data type is used, but the register is a larger type, then the value will be truncated to fit that type.

## Fundamental Data Types

### Integer Types

| Type    | Size (bits) | Range                                                   | Notes                                                                |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Byte`  | 8           | -128 to 127                                             | Signed 8-bit integer.                                                |
| `Short` | 16          | -32,768 to 32,767                                       | Signed 16-bit integer.                                               |
| `Int`   | 32          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         | Signed 32-bit integer.                                               |
| `Long`  | 64          | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | Signed 64-bit integer.  This is the default data type for registers. |

### Floating-Point Types

| Type     | Size (bits) | Notes                                              |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Float`  | 32          | Single-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). |
| `Double` | 64          | Double-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). |

### String Type

Strings are represented as null-terminated sequences of characters in memory. Each character occupies one word (64
bits).

### Boolean Type

Boolean values are represented using 64-bit Longs. The integer value of 0 represents false, and 1 represents true.

## Register Data Types

The `SETTYPE` instruction allows you to change the data type stored in a register at runtime. This allows for flexible
use of memory by being able to change data types as needed.

| Data Type | Description                                               | Size (bits) | Example                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `Byte`    | 8-bit signed integer                                      | 8           | `settype G1 Byte`           |
| `Short`   | 16-bit signed integer                                     | 16          | `settype G1 Short`          |
| `Int`     | 32-bit signed integer                                     | 32          | `settype G1 Int`            |
| `Long`    | 64-bit signed integer (default for registers).            | 64          | `settype G1 Long` (default) |
| `Float`   | 32-bit single-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). | 32          | `settype X1 Float`          |
| `Double`  | 64-bit double-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). | 64          | `settype X1 Double`         |

## Memory Representation

All values are stored in memory as 64-bit Longs regardless of the data type. This is to ensure consistency throughout
the memory. You can use smaller data types in registers, but memory always works with 64-bit Longs.

This document describes the data types used within the MVM. It's essential to understand these types when writing
assembly code for the MVM.

# MVM Standard Library Overview

The MVM standard library provides reusable functions to enhance MVM programs. These functions handle common tasks and
offer higher-level abstractions. All functions use the stack for arguments and return values. The library is organised
into modules, each focusing on a specific area of functionality.

## Library Modules

The standard library is structured into the following modules:

### String Functions

This module provides string manipulation functions. Functions operate on null-terminated strings, and memory management
is handled automatically. The available functions are:

- `strcmp`: Compares two strings lexicographically. Returns 1 if equal, 0 otherwise.
- `strcat`: Concatenates two strings. Returns the address of the new string.
- `strcpy`: Copies a string from a source to a destination. Returns the destination address.
- `strlen`: Returns the length of a string.

### Array Functions

This module provides array-related functions. The functions support array creation, access, and manipulation. Arrays
created with `createArray` can be cleared using `clean.array`. The available functions are:

- `create`: Creates a new array. Returns the address of the new array.
- `get`: Gets an element from an array. Returns the element's value.
- `size`: Returns the size of an array.

### Maths Functions

This module contains standard mathematical functions. For floating-point functions, operands must be of the same type.
The functions are:

- `min`: Returns the smaller of two values.
- `max`: Returns the larger of two values.
- `inc`: Increments a value by 1.
- `dec`: Decrements a value by 1.
- `neg`: Negates a value.
- `sq`: Squares a value.

### Clean Functions

This module handles clearing parts of memory automatically. The functions are

- `array`: Clears an array.
- `string`: Clears a string.

### IO Functions

This module handles simple I/O operations, including console input and output. The functions are:

- `println`: Prints a string to the console with a newline.
- `readln`: Reads a line of input from standard input and returns its address.

### System Functions

This module is responsible for system-related functions The functions are

- `exit`: Exits the program

### Conversion Functions

This module contains data type conversion functions. The available functions are:

- `asciiToInt`: Converts an ASCII character to its integer representation.
- `strtoint`: Converts a string to a, long.
- `findFirstString`: Finds the first occurrence of a character within a string.

## Calling Standard Library Functions

Standard library functions are called using the `CALL` instruction:

```assembly
call strings.strlen  // Call the strlen function
```

Arguments are passed in F registers (F1, F2, etc.), and the return value (if any) is pushed onto the stack.

## Further Information

Refer to the [Standard Library Table](Standard-Library-Table.md) for detailed information on each function, including
argument types and return values.

# MVM Instruction Set

This document details the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) instruction set. Instructions are categorised for clarity. The MVM
uses a 64-bit architecture, and all instructions are 64 bits wide unless otherwise specified. Multi-word instructions
use two words. The MVM uses a stack-based architecture for function calls and return values.

## Data Transfer Instructions

These instructions move data between registers and memory.

### LIT

**`lit` `Destination Register` `Value` (Long Literal)**

Loads a 64-bit integer literal `Value` into the `Destination` register

```assembly
lit G1 10       // G1 = 10
```

### XLIT

**`xlit` `Destination Register` `Value` (Double/Float Literal)**

Loads a floating-point literal `Value` into the `Destination` register. The data type (Float or Double) is determined at
runtime based on the data type assigned to the register by the `SETTYPE` instruction.

```assembly
xlit X1 3.14159 // X1 = 3.14159 (as a Double)
```

To load as a single-precision Float:

```assembly
settype X1 Float // Set X1's data type to Float
xlit X1 3.14159 // X1 = 3.14159 (as a Float)
```

### MOV

**`mov` `Source Register` `Destination Register` (Register Value)**

Moves a value from the `Source` register to the `Destination` register.

```assembly
mov G1 G2       // G2 = G1
```

### SWP

**`swp` `Register1` `Register2` (Register Value)**

Swaps the values of `Register1` and `Register2`.

```assembly
swp G1 G2       // G1 <-> G2 (G1 and G2 exchange values)
```

### SETTYPE

**`settype` `Target Register` `DataType` (RegisterDataType)**

Sets the data type of the `Target` register. If the current value is too large or too small for the new data type, it
will be truncated.

```assembly
settype G1 Long // G1 is now a Long
```

The available data types are: `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`.

### STORE

**`store` `Source Register` `MemoryAddress Register` (Register Value)**

Stores the value from the `Source` register into the memory location whose address is in the `MemoryAddress` register.

```assembly
store G1 G2     // Memory[G2] = G1
```

### LOAD

**`load` `MemoryAddress Register` `Destination Register` (Register Value)**

Loads the value from the memory location specified by the `MemoryAddress` register into the `Destination` register.

```assembly
load G2 G1      // G1 = Memory[G2]
```

### PUSH

**`push` `Source Register` (Register Value)**

Pushes the value from the `Source` register onto the stack. The stack grows downwards.

```assembly
push G1         // Push G1 onto the stack
```

### PUSHL

**`pushl` `Value` (Long Literal)**

Pushes the 64-bit integer literal `Value` onto the stack.

```assembly
pushl 100       // Push 100 onto the stack
```

### POP

**`pop` `Destination Register` (Register Value)**

Pops a value from the top of the stack and stores it in the `Destination` register. Handles stack underflow.

```assembly
pop G1          // G1 = top of stack; pop the stack
```

### PEEK

**`peek` `Destination Register` (Register Value)**

Copies the value at the top of the stack into the `Destination` register without removing it from the stack. Handles
stack underflow.

```assembly
peek G1         // G1 = top of stack; stack unchanged
```

## Arithmetic Instructions

These instructions perform arithmetic operations. Results are pushed onto the stack.

### ADD

**`add` `Addend1` `Addend2` `ResultDestination Register` (Register Value)**

Adds `Addend1` and `Addend2`; a result is pushed onto the stack.

```assembly
add G1 G2 R4    // Push G1 + G2 onto stack
```

### SUB

**`sub` `Minuend` `Subtrahend` `ResultDestination Register` (Register Value)**

Subtracts `Subtrahend` from `Minuend`; a result is pushed onto the stack.

```assembly
sub G1 G2 R4    // Push G1 - G2 onto stack

div G1 G2 R4    // Push G1 / G2 onto stack
```

### MOD

**`mod` `Dividend` `Divisor` `ResultDestination Register` (Register Value)**

Calculates the modulo of `Dividend` and `Divisor`; a result is pushed onto the stack. Throws an exception if the divisor
is zero.

```assembly
mod G1 G2 R4    // Push G1 % G2 onto stack
```

### POW

Raises `Base` to the power of `Exponent` (integer exponentiation); a result is pushed onto the stack. Handles potential
overflow.

```assembly
pow G1 G2 R4    // Push G1 ^ G2 onto stack
```

## Bitwise Instructions

These instructions perform bitwise operations. Results are pushed onto the stack.

### AND

**`and` `Operand1` `Operand2` `ResultDestination Register` (Register Value)**

Performs a bitwise AND operation; a result is pushed onto the stack.

# MVM Process Management

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel manages the creation, execution, and termination of processes.
Processes run concurrently within the VM's emulated environment, using cooperative multitasking.
The kernel uses a round-robin scheduler.

## Process States

A process in the MVM can be in one of the following states:

- **RUNNING:** The process is currently executing instructions.
- **CANCELLED:** The process has terminated by another process.
- **PAUSED:** The process is paused by another process.

## Process Control Block (KProcess)

The kernel represents each process using a `KProcess` object.
This object acts as the process control block (PCB), storing all essential information about the process:

- **`id`:**  A unique integer identifier for the process.  (Assigned when a process is created).
- **`vm`:** An instance of the `Vm` class, representing the VM's state for this process.
  Each process gets its own VM
  object.
- **`file`:** A `File` object, the path to the program that the process runs.
- **`instructionMemory`:** A list of `InstructData` objects that represent the instructions in the program.
- **`ipcPermissions`:** A list of mailbox IDs for inter-process communication (IPC) that this process has access to.
- **`parent`:** The ID of the process's parent process (or `null` for the initial process).
- **`thread`:** The Kotlin `Thread` that executes instructions for the process.

This data is stored and managed by the kernel.

## Process Creation (`fork` and `spawn`)

The kernel provides two system calls for creating processes:

- **`fork()`:** Creates a new process, a copy of the current process.
  The child process has its own memory space,
  registers, and stack, but it starts with the same code as the parent.
  returns the child process's PID to
  the parent process and 0 to the child process.
  The `thread` is determined by the VM itself.
  The process is initialised at runtime in `KProcess.init`
- **`spawn(programPath.kar)`:** Creates a new process under the VM using the assembly code, using the file specified by
  `programPath.kar`.
  It will not inherit the
  state of the parent process.
  The process is added to the scheduler's ready queue.

## Process Termination (`HALT`)

HALT is added by the OS automatically and is inaccessible to the programmer.
A process terminates by calling the `HALT` key word.
The kernel will remove the process from the scheduler's ready queue.
This is different from the exit system call which exits the entire VM, working on a fix.

## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Inter-process communication is managed through mailboxes.
Each process has a list of mailbox IDs (`ipcPermissions`) which it has access to.
The OS manages mailboxes.
Processes communicate by sending (`send`) and receiving (`receive`) messages.
Processes can establish connections with other processes using the `link` system call.

This document provides an overview of process management in the MVM. For detailed information about the `KProcess` class
and system calls,
refer to other sections in this wiki.

# MVM Kernel Scheduler

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel uses a scheduler to manage the concurrent execution of multiple processes.
The scheduler employs a round-robin algorithm,
allocating a single instruction cycle to each process before switching to the next.
This approach prioritises simplicity and reliability over complex scheduling strategies.

## Round-Robin Scheduling

The round-robin algorithm is a simple and efficient scheduling technique, particularly well-suited to the MVM's design.
Each process in the ready queue is given a single instruction cycle to execute.
After the instruction completes, the scheduler selects the next process from the ready queue,
effectively creating a circular order of execution.

## Scheduler Data Structures

The scheduler uses the following data structures:

- **Ready Queue:** A queue (`LinkedList`) containing the PIDs of processes ready to run. Processes are added to the
  ready queue when they are created or become ready after being blocked.
- **Running Process:** A variable to store the PID of the currently running process.

## Scheduler Algorithm

The scheduler's algorithm is straightforward.
Its function (`eventLoop`) iterates through a list of processes (`keepPcs`),
executing a single instruction per process in a round-robin fashion:

1. **Get Next Process:** Retrieve the next process from the ready queue (using `getNextProcess()`).
2. **Load Process State:** Load the process's state (registers, program counter, etc.) from its PCB (`KProcess`).
3. **Execute Instruction:** Execute a single instruction.
4. **Save Process State:** Save the process's state back into the PCB using the kernels `snapShotManager`.
5. **Add to Ready Queue (if not finished):** Add the process to the back of the ready queue, unless the process has
   ended.

This is repeated until all processes in `keepPcs` are finished.

## Handling Process Termination

When a process terminates (e.g., by executing the `exit` system call or completing its instructions),
the scheduler removes it from the ready queue.

## Integration with the Kernel

The scheduler is integrated into the kernel (`os/OS.kt`).
The kernel is responsible for managing process creation, termination, and other tasks related to process management.
The scheduler runs continuously to ensure processes are able to execute their instructions.

## Limitations of Round-Robin

This scheduling model does not prioritise certain processes or consider their CPU usage.
It also does not support preemption, and processes are limited to executing a single instruction at a time.
A long-running process that does not perform system calls will not give up the processor.

This document provides an overview of the MVM kernel scheduler.

# MVM Virtual Devices

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) supports virtual devices that provide an interface between user-space programs and the
operating system (kernel). These devices are implemented as drivers within the kernel and are accessed via system calls.

## Virtual File System (VFS)

**Keynote!!!**
This is only in a specific branch in [vfs-v2](https://github.com/ChippyPlus/micro-vm/tree/vfs-v2).
And all of these features aren’t yet available in master

The virtual file system (VFS) is a crucial virtual device, providing file system functionality within the MVM. The VFS
is implemented as a driver within the kernel (`os/drivers/VFS.kt`). It handles file and directory operations. The VFS is
persistent, using a file (`vfs.fs`) to save and load its state. System calls provide access to the VFS.

The VFS supports:

- **File Creation:**  Creating new files using `newFile`.
- **File Deletion:** Deleting files and directories using `deleteFile`.
- **Reading Files:** Reading data from files into memory (`readFile`).
- **Writing Files:** Writing data from memory to files (`writeFile`).
- **Listing Files:** Listing files within directories (`listFiles`).
- **Directory Creation:**  Creating directories using `newDir`.

### VFS Data Structures

The VFS uses the following data structures:

- **`Ventry`:** A generic entry (file or directory) in the VFS. It contains the file/directory name, content (if a
  file), permissions, metadata (size, creation time), and a list of child `Ventry` objects (if it's a directory).
- **`Permissions`:** This structure defines the access permissions for a VFS entry (read, write).
- **`Meta`:** Contains metadata for a file or directory.

### VFS System Calls

The VFS is accessed using the following system calls:

- `newFile`: Creates a new file.
- `readFile`: Reads data from a file.
- `writeFile`: Writes data to a file.
- `deleteFile`: Deletes a file or directory.
- `listFiles`: Lists files and directories.
- `newDir`: Creates a new directory.

The function arguments, return values, and error handling for the VFS system calls are documented in
the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table).

## Other Virtual Devices

In addition to the VFS, the MVM kernel supports several other virtual devices, providing various functionalities within
the VM's emulated environment.
These devices are implemented as drivers in Kotlin:

### Console I/O

The console I/O driver provides system calls for interacting with a virtual console or terminal:

- `writeIo`: Writes data to the console.
- `readIo`: Reads input from the console.

### Timer

The MVM's scheduler uses a timer (not implemented as a virtual device) that counts instruction cycles. The timer doesn’t
have any system calls. Instead, the timer's counter is incremented after every instruction's execution. This counter
triggers a context switch once it reaches the maximum value set in the configuration file.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

The kernel manages IPC using mailboxes.
These are implemented using stacks (`kernel.Ipc.MessagePassing.mailBoxes`).
The following system calls provide access to the IPC:

- `link`: Establishes a link (connection) between two processes.
- `send`: Sends a message to another process.
- `receive`: Receives a message from another process.

This document provides an overview of virtual devices in the MVM. For more detailed information, refer to
the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table.md) and the specific documentation for each virtual device.

```markdown
## Getting Started with MVM

This guide helps you set up and run the Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) to execute assembly code. This guide is for macOS
and Linux systems.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** MVM is written in Kotlin, which requires a JDK. Ensure you have JDK 17 or later
  installed. You can download it
  from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ChippyPlus/micro-vm.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd micro-vm
   ```

### Building the Project

1. **Execute with Gradle:** This builds the project and creates the executable JAR file.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Running Assembly Code

You can run your MVM assembly code (`.kar` files) using the following methods:

**Method 1: Using Gradle (Recommended for Development)**

1. **Execute with Gradle:** This runs the MVM from the JAR file, executing a `.kar` file provided as an argument.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew r --args="irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>"
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_assembly_file.kar>` with the path to your assembly file. For example:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew r --args="irun src/main/resources/programs/helloworld.kar"
   ```

**Method 2: Using the Executable JAR**

1. **Locate the JAR:** After building the project, find the JAR file (`MVM-1.0.jar` or similar) in the `build/libs/`
   directory.
2. **Run with Java:**
   ```bash
   java -jar build/libs/MVM-1.0.jar irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>
   ```

**Method 3: Using an Alias**

1. **Create an alias:** This creates a shell alias to simplify running the MVM.
   ```bash
   alias mvm="java -jar build/libs/MVM-1.0.jar"
   ```
2. **Run with the alias:**
   ```bash
   mvm irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>
   ```

### Clean Up

If you do not plan to build the project again, it's recommended to remove the Gradle cache files:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.gradle
```

### Example

Here's a simple MVM assembly program (`myprogram.kar`):

```assembly
// Example HelloWorld program 

STR F1 "Hello, World!"   // Load string into memory and returns pointer to F1
call println             // Prints the string located in F1 to stdout

```

To run this program, use one of the above commands, replacing `<path_to_assembly_file.kar>` with `myprogram.kar`. The
output will be printed to the console.

Now you can start writing and executing your own assembly programs. Refer to
the [Instruction Table](Instruction-Table.md)
for a list of instructions and their syntax.

# Micro Virtual Machine (MVM)

**A Kotlin-based Educational Virtual Machine**

This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for the Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) project, an educational virtual
machine designed to explore the fundamentals of operating system and virtual machine architecture.

## Project Overview

The MVM project aims to create a flexible and extensible virtual machine implemented in Kotlin. It serves as a platform
for learning and experimenting with low-level programming concepts within a higher-level language environment. This
rewrite focuses on simulating a time-sharing operating system kernel within the virtual machine.

## Key Features

* **Custom Assembly Language:** The virtual machine uses a straightforward assembly language for writing programs.
  Instructions support data movement, arithmetic, stack operations, control flow, memory access, and system calls.
* **Dynamic Register Sizing:** Registers can have their data type changed at runtime, providing flexibility and memory
  efficiency.
* **Multi-Process Support:** The virtual machine can run multiple programs concurrently as distinct processes,
  simulating a time-sharing OS on a single (emulated) core.
* **Virtual File System (VFS):** A virtual file system enables programs to interact with files and directories within
  the VM.
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Provides mechanisms (message passing) for processes to communicate with each
  other.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The virtual machine uses a dedicated set of Intel registers to manage error conditions.
  This provides informative error messages and the ability to handle errors gracefully, without halting the entire
  system.
* **Extensible Design:** The modular design of the project makes it easier to add new features, instructions, and
  standard library functions.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the virtual machine, please refer to
the [Installation and Setup](Getting-Started.md) guide.

## Explore the Documentation

The MVM's documentation is organised to guide you from basic concepts to more advanced topics. Please consult the
sidebar for quick navigation. The documentation is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for the project's
design and implementation details.

# MVM Kernel Overview

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel is a time-sharing kernel designed for educational purposes.
It manages multiple processes concurrently within the VM's emulated environment.
The kernel is implemented in Kotlin and runs separately from the VM's user-space processes;
user programs interact with the kernel via system calls.
The kernel itself does not reside in the VM's emulated memory.

## Key Kernel Components

The MVM kernel comprises the following key components:

### Scheduler

The scheduler manages the execution of processes,
allocating a single instruction cycle to each process before switching.
The MVM kernel uses a round-robin scheduler.
The scheduler maintains a ready queue of processes waiting for execution.
The scheduler is invoked after each instruction completes execution.

### Process Manager

This component is responsible for creating, managing, and terminating processes. Key data structures include:

- **Process Control Block (PCB):** Represented by the `KProcess`(Kernel Active Process) class, this data structure
  stores information about each process (PID, registers, memory, state, etc.).
- **System Calls:** The kernel provides system calls for process creation (`fork`, `spawn`), termination (`exit`), and
  other process-related operations.

### Snap Shot Manager

The snapshot manager keeps track of the state of each process at any given time during execution.
When the kernel switches between processes, it snapshots the state the active process and saved it in memory.
This includes

* Registers
* Memory
* Pc

### Virtual File System (VFS)

The VFS driver manages file system operations within the VM
and is responsible for implementing a set of system calls for file operations.
The VFS is persistent, saving and loading data from the `vfs.fs` file.

### Virtual Devices

The kernel includes drivers for virtual devices:

- **Console I/O:** Provides system calls for console input (`readIo`) and output (`writeIo`).
- **Timer:** The timer is not emulated as a virtual device.
  Instead, the scheduler is driven by a counter that
  increments after each instruction cycle.
  This is private to the VM itself

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

The kernel manages IPC between processes using message passing mailboxes.

### System Call Handler

This component intercepts system calls from user-space programs, dispatching them to the appropriate kernel functions.

## Execution Model

The MVM uses a round-robin scheduling model.
Each process receives a single instruction before the scheduler switches to another process.
Processes do not block on system calls; they execute one instruction at a time.
This design prioritises reliability and simplicity when handling many concurrent processes.

This document gives a high-level overview of the MVM kernel.

# Plans & Enhancements

## I. Language and Runtime Enhancements

1. **Customizable Syntax:** Allow users to define their own syntax for MVM assembly language, enabling domain-specific
   languages or personalised coding styles.
2. **Built-in Data Structures:** Implement built-in support for more complex data structures like hash maps, trees, and
   graphs, accessible through standard library functions or new instructions.
3. **Type Inference:** Add type inference to your higher-level language (if you create one), reducing the need for
   explicit type declarations.
4. **Automatic Memory Management:** Explore garbage collection algorithms (mark-and-sweep, reference counting) to
   automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.
5. **Reflection API:** Allow programs running on the VM to inspect and manipulate their own structure and behaviour (
   e.g., access register values, inspect the call stack).
6. **Dynamic Linking:** Enable dynamic linking of libraries or modules, allowing programs to load and use external code
   at runtime.

## II. Virtualisation and System-Level Features

7. **Nested Virtualisation:** Allow running a VM *inside* your MVM!  (Requires careful resource management).
8. **Hardware Emulation (Beyond Simple Devices):** Emulate more complex hardware, like a simplified GPU, sound card, or
   network card with packet routing capabilities.
9. **Virtual Machine Introspection:** Provide tools or system calls that allow VM programs to inspect and modify the
   VM's state.
10. **Snapshots and Checkpointing:** Enable saving and restoring the complete VM state or creating checkpoints during
	program execution for debugging and fault tolerance.
11. **Process Migration:** Allow migrating running processes between different instances of your MVM (if you have
	multiple VMs running).
12. **System Call Sandboxing:** Implement security mechanisms to restrict system call access for untrusted programs.

## III. Concurrency and Parallelism

13. **User-Level Threads:** Implement user-level threads within the VM, managed by a user-space thread library.
14. **Multicore Support:** Extend the VM to support multiple emulated cores, enabling true parallelism.  (Requires a
	more sophisticated scheduler.)
15. **Asynchronous I/O:** Implement asynchronous I/O operations for virtual devices, allowing processes to continue
	execution while waiting for I/O to complete.
16. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Instructions:** Add SIMD instructions to perform parallel operations on
	vectors of data.

## IV. Debugging and Development Tools

17. **Time-Travel Debugging:** Implement a debugger that allows stepping backward through program execution to analyse
	program behaviour.
18. **Code Coverage Analysis:** Add tools to measure code coverage during testing.
19. **Performance Profiler:** Develop tools to profile CPU usage, memory access patterns, and other performance metrics.
20. **Bytecode Disassembler:** Create a tool to disassemble MVM bytecode back into assembly language for easier
	analysis.

## V. Advanced VM Features

21. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Compile frequently executed bytecode into native machine code for performance
	gains (challenging, as it's architecture-specific).
22. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler:** Compile MVM bytecode into native executables for specific platforms.
23. **Garbage Collection:** Implement garbage collection algorithms to automate memory management.
24. **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Allow MVM programs to call functions written in other languages (e.g., C/C++).
25. **Bytecode Verification:** Add bytecode verification to ensure that loaded programs are well-formed and don't
	violate security policies.

## VI. Random Ideas

26. **Non-Deterministic Execution:** Implement instructions with probabilistic outcomes, creating a non-deterministic
	execution environment (interesting for simulations or genetic algorithms).
27. **MVM as a Service:** Create a web service that allows users to upload and run MVM programs remotely.

This document details planned enhancements for the MVM. This is a high-level view, and the prioritisation and specifics
are subject to change.

# Introduction to MVM Assembly Language

This page provides a gentle introduction to the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) assembly language. MVM assembly is a
low-level language designed for a simple, time-sharing virtual machine. It allows you to write programs by providing a
set of instructions that manipulate data stored in registers and memory. The virtual machine manages multiple processes
concurrently.

## Basic Concepts

* **Registers:** The MVM uses several types of registers:
	* **General Purpose Registers (G1-G10):** Used for general computations and data storage.
	* **System Registers (S1-S4):** Used for passing arguments to system calls.  `S1` holds the system call ID.
	* **Return Registers (R1-R10):** Used to store the results of operations and system calls.
	* **Function Argument Registers (F1-F10):** Used for passing arguments to functions.
	* **Floating-Point Registers (X1-X10):** Used for floating-point arithmetic.
	* **Intel Registers (I1-I10):** Hold status flags and other information.
* **Memory:** The MVM has a fixed amount of memory, accessed using addresses. Each address holds a 64-bit integer.
* **Stack:** A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure for temporary storage. Used for function calls return values.
* **Instructions:** Instructions specify operations. Each instruction has a mnemonic (e.g., `ADD`, `MOV`) and
  arguments (operands).
* **System Calls:** Functions to interact with the operating system (OS plus Kernel), such as file I/O, process
  management, and more. These are invoked using the `SYSCALL` instruction, which takes the system call ID as an
  argument.

## Example Program

This simple program adds two numbers and prints the result:

```assembly
LIT G1 10      // Load 10 into G1
LIT G2 5       // Load 5 into G2
ADD G1 G2 R1   // Add G1 and G2; result in R4
PRINTR R1      // Print the value in R4 (15)
```

## Key Instruction Categories

* **Data Transfer:** `LIT`, `XLIT`, `MOV`, `STORE`, `LOAD`, `PUSH`, `POP`, `PEEK`, `CPY`, `SETTYPE`, `DEALLOC`
* **Arithmetic:** `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `MOD`, `POW`,
* **Bitwise:** `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `SHL`, `SHR`
* **XFloats:** `XADD`, `XSUB`, `XMUL`, `XDIV`, `XMOD`, `XPOW`, `ITOF`,    `FTOI`
* **Control Flow:** `JMP`, `JZ`, `JNZ`, `CALL`, `RET`
* **String:** `STR`
* **I/O:** `PRINTS`, `PRINTR`
* **System Calls:** `SYSCALL`
* **Miscellaneous:** `INR`, `HELP`, `SLEEP`

# ASCII Table

## Notes

* **ASCII control characters (character code 0–31)** The first 32 characters in the `ASCII-table` are unprintable
  control codes and are
  used to
  control peripherals such as printers
* **ASCII printable characters (character code 32–127)** Codes 32–127 are common for all the different variations of the
  ASCII table, they are called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few
  miscellaneous symbols. You will find almost every character on your keyboard. Character 127 represents the command
  DEL.

# MVM Registers

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) uses registers to store data actively being processed.
Registers provide fast access to data during program execution. The MVM uses several types of registers, each serving a
specific purpose. All registers are 64 bits wide unless otherwise noted.

## Register Types

### General Purpose Registers (G1-G10)

These registers are used for general computations, data storage, and calculations. They can be used as operands in all
instructions.

```assembly
lit G1 10       // Load the literal value 10 into register G1
```

### System Registers (S1-S4)

These registers are used for system calls. `S1` holds the system call ID; `S2`, `S3`, and `S4` pass arguments to the
system call.

```assembly
lit S1 24            // Load system call 24 (writeIo) into S1
mov G1 S2            // Pass string address to S2
syscall              // Make system call
```

### Return Registers (R1-R10)

These registers typically hold the results of operations (arithmetic, comparison, bitwise) and system calls

- `R1` is usually returned by standard library operations
- `R2` is conventionally used for system call return values.
- `R3` typically holds results from bitwise operations.
- `R4` conventionally holds results from arithmetic, comparison, and string operations.
- `R5` conventionally holds results from floating-point operations. Note `R5` By default is a FLOAT Register type so
  this
  is recommended.
- `R6` conventionally holds results from `INR` instructions.

```assembly
add G1 G2 R4   // Result of addition is in R4
```

### Function Argument Registers (F1-F10)

These registers are used exclusively for passing arguments to functions (subroutines). Arguments are placed in these
registers **before** the function call.

```assembly
lit F1 10           // Load argument 1 into F1
call maths.sq       // Call the square function
prints              // Print the result on the stack, 100. 10 * 10 
```

### Floating-Point Registers (X1-X10)

These registers are used for floating-point arithmetic operations. By default these are Floats. Not Doubles

```assembly
xlit X1 3.14159 //  Load a floating-point literal
```

### Intel Registers (I1-I10)

These registers hold status flags and other metadata. They are set implicitly by various instructions and are not
directly modified by most instructions.

- `I1`  Set if the last operation resulted in zero.
- `I2`  Set if the last arithmetic operation's result was negative.
- `I3`  Set according to the last `GT` or `LT` comparison.
- `I4`  Set if the last `EQ` comparison was true.
- `I5`  Indicates system call success.
- `I6`  Indicates a general error.
- `I7`  Holds a code specifying the error type.
- `I8`  Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
- `I9`  Set when a signal is received.
- `I10` Stores the ID for inter-process communication.

see for more information → [Informational Registers](Informational-Registers.md)

## Register Size

All registers are 64 bits wide, capable of storing 64-bit integer values, or a floating point number of any type,
depending on the register data type assigned using the `SETTYPE` instruction.
The options are BYTE, SHORT, INT, LONG, FLOAT, and DOUBLE.

## Register Access

Registers are accessed by name (e.g., `G1`, `S2`, `R4`, `X1`, `I8`) in MVM assembly instructions.

## Register Initialization

Registers are initialised to 0 when a process is created.

## Example: Function Call

```assembly
lit F1 5         // Load argument 1 into F1
lit F2 1         // Load argument 2 into F2
call test        // Call the test function
pop R1           // Get the return value from the stack
```

## Memory vs. Registers

Registers offer faster access than memory. Store frequently accessed data in registers. Use memory for larger data
structures or data not requiring constant access. `STORE` and `LOAD` instructions transfer data between registers and
memory.

Refer to the [Instruction Set](Instruction-Set.md) documentation for more examples of register usage.

# MVM System Calls Overview

System calls provide a mechanism for MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) programs to request services from the operating system
(kernel).
All system calls use the stack for arguments and return values.
The system call ID is passed in register `S1`.

## System Call Categories

The system calls are categorised for clarity:

### File System Calls

These system calls interact with the virtual file system (VFS):

- `newFile`: Creates a new file.
- `readFile`: Reads data from a file.
- `writeFile`: Writes data to a file.
- `deleteFile`: Deletes a file or directory.

### Process Management Calls

**Very UNSTABLE!**

These system calls manage processes within the MVM:

- `exec`: Executes a new program from the host operating system.
- `fork`: Creates a child process (a copy of the current process).
- `spawn`: Creates a new process and runs a program file.
- `exit`: Terminates the current process.
- `getpid`: Gets the process ID of the current process.
- `getuid`: Gets the user ID of the current process.
- `handleSignals`: Registers a signal handler for the process.
- `sendSignal`: Sends a signal to another process.
- `pause_t`: Pauses a specified process.
- `continue_t`: Resumes a paused process.

### IPC Calls

**Very UNSTABLE!**
These system calls provide inter-process communication (IPC):

- `share_m`: Establishes a shared memory region between two processes.
- `send`: Sends a message to another process using message passing.
- `receive`: Receives a message from another process.

### Host OS Calls

These system calls interact with the host operating system:

- `time`: Gets the current system time.

### Other System Calls

These system calls provide other miscellaneous functionality:

- `writeIo`: Writes a null-terminated string to standard output.
- `readIo`: Reads a line from standard input.
- `createArray`: Creates a new array.
- `arraySet`: Sets an array element.
- `arrayGet`: Gets an array element.

## Making System Calls

System calls are invoked using the `syscall` instruction.
The system call ID (`SystemCallID`) is in register `S1`.
Arguments are passed in `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`.
Return values (if any) are stored in `R2`

```assembly
lit S1 14        // Load system call ID 14 (time) into S1
syscall              // Make the system call
```

## Further Information

For a detailed list of system calls, their arguments, return values,
and notes, refer to the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table.md).

# MVM Memory Model

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) uses a linear memory model with a fixed size. All memory locations are directly
addressable using 64-bit addresses. The MVM's memory is a single contiguous block.

## Memory Addressing

The MVM uses direct addressing. The operand of a memory access instruction (`LOAD`, `STORE`) specifies the memory
address directly. These are *physical addresses* within the VM's single memory block. There is no virtual addressing or
memory segmentation in this model.

The MVM performs boundary checks when accessing memory. Attempting to read from or write to a memory address outside the
allocated range for the current process will raise an exception.

```assembly
lit G1 100       // Value to store
lit G2 50        // Memory address 
store G1 G2      // Store 100 at address 50
```

## String Storage

Strings are stored as null-terminated arrays of 64-bit words. Each word holds one character (ASCII). The null
terminator (value 0) marks the end of the string. Memory for strings is allocated dynamically.

```assembly
str G1 "Hello"   ; Store "Hello"; G1 contains string's starting address
```

This looks like `104 | 101 | 108 | 108 | 111 | 0 ` in memory

## Array Storage

Arrays are stored contiguously in memory.
The first word contains the array's size (number of elements).
Later
words hold array elements.
The data type of array elements is specified during array creation using the `createArray`
system call.

```assembly
// Create array of size 10, Longs
lit S1 26		// Array Create
lit S2 10		// Size of 10
syscall			// Result: Array base address in R2

// Store value 50 at index 0
lit S1 27 		// Array Set
mov R2 S2		// Move Array to S2
lit S3 0		// Index 0
lit S4 50		// Value 50
syscall			// arraySet
```

This document explains the MVM's linear memory model, how memory is addressed, and how strings and arrays are stored.
The MVM uses direct addressing and allocates memory for strings dynamically.

# MVM: A Micro Virtual Machine

Welcome to the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) project! This is an experimental virtual machine written in Kotlin, designed
for educational purposes and to explore the fundamentals of virtual machine architecture.

**PLEASE LOOK**   
Keep in mind that this project is **STILL IN THE PROGRESS** and may parts are unfinished. I recommend you look into the
code yourself to see whats implemented.   
AND These docs are being changed. For instance some of the syscall/instruction tables are wrong because they are busy
being changed in production

## Project Overview

MVM is a simple, stack-based virtual machine that executes a custom assembly language. It features:

- **Custom Byte-code Language:**  A small, human-readable assembly language with instructions for data movement,
  arithmetic, stack operations, control flow, memory access, and system calls.
- **Fixed Memory:**  The VM uses a fixed amount of memory that is universally accessible to simplify memory management.
- **Error Handling:**  The VM uses exceptions to handle runtime errors, providing informative error messages.

## Documentation

For documentation please check the wiki tab!   
Over here → [wiki tab](https://github.com/ChippyPlus/MVM/wiki)!

## Features

- **Basic Instruction Set:** Includes instructions for data movement (`MOV`, `LIT`), arithmetic (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`,
  `DIV`), stack operations (`PUSH`, `POP`, `PEEK`), control flow (`JMP`, `JZ`, `JNZ`), memory access (`LOAD`, `STORE`),
  system calls (`SYSCALL`), and others.
- **System Calls:**  The VM supports a limited set of system calls for basic interactions with the operating system.
- **Error Handling:** The VM uses custom exception types to handle runtime errors, providing specific error messages and
  exit codes.

## Getting Started

Look over here [Getting started](https://github.com/ChippyPlus/MVM/wiki/Getting-Started)!

## Example of the VM byte code

```assembly
// Example program to print the number 10
LIT G1 10       // Load the value 10 into register G1
PUSH G1         // Push G1 onto the stack
PRINTS          // Print what evers on the stack
```

# MVM System Call Implementation

This document details how system calls are implemented in the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine). System calls provide a mechanism for user-space programs to request services from the kernel.

## System Call Interface

User programs invoke system calls using the `syscall` instruction. The system call ID is passed in register `S1`. Arguments are passed in registers `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`. The result (if any) are stored in `R2` by the system call handler.


## System Call Handling

The system call mechanism involves:

1. **`syscall` Instruction:** A user program executes the `syscall` instruction.

2. **Trap:** The VM's execution engine detects the `syscall` instruction. This triggers a trap or interrupt, switching execution to kernel mode.

3. **System Call Handler (`SystemCallHandler.kt`):** The system call handler:
   - Retrieves the system call ID from register `S1`.
   - Retrieves any arguments passed by the user program from registers `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`.
   - Calls the appropriate kernel function to handle the system call.  This is handled in the `SystemCall.execute` function which uses a `when` statement to call the correct function.
   - Stores the return values (if any) in `R2`.

4. **Return to User Mode:**  Once the system call is handled, execution returns to the user program.


## Example: `readFile` System Call

Let's trace the steps for `readFile`:

1. **User Program:**  A user program calls `readFile` using the `syscall` instruction:
   ```assembly
   lit S1 2         		// System call ID for readFile	
   str S2 "file name.txt"	// Address of the filename string
   syscall             		// Make system call
   printr R2           		// Retrieve the result (address of data) 
   ```

2. **Trap:** The `syscall` instruction causes a trap to the kernel.

3. **System Call Handler:**
   - The system call handler in `SystemCallHandler.kt` detects the system call ID (`2`).
   - It calls the `readFile` function in `internals.systemCalls.calls.readFile.kt`, passing the filename address (`filename_address`) from register `S2`.

4.  **`readFile` Function (`internals.systemCalls.calls.readFile.kt`):**

  ```kotlin
  fun SystemCall.readFile(nameX: RegisterType) = call("readFile") {
      val name = helpers.readRegisterString(nameX)
      val out = (vm.vfs.read(name) ?: errors.FileNotFoundException(name)) as String
      val spot = helpers.writeClosestString(out)
      registers.write(RegisterType.R2, spot)
  }
  ```

- This function interacts with the virtual file system (`vm.vfs`) to read the file's content.
- The function then uses the `writeClosestString` helper function to copy the data into memory.
- The function places the address of the data (from the VFS) on the stack.

5. **Return to User Mode:** The system call handler returns control to the user program.  The user program can then access the data from the address stored in `R2`.

## Key Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Each system call function should implement robust error handling, returning error codes or raising exceptions.  The system call handler should manage these errors appropriately.
* **Concurrency:** You'll need to ensure that system calls are handled concurrently if you have multiple processes running.  Synchronisation mechanisms might be needed if a system call involves shared resources.
* **Kernel Design:** The design of your kernel (in `os/OS.kt`) determines how efficient and robust system calls are.
* **Documentation:** Clearly document each system call, its arguments, return values, and potential error conditions in your System Call Table and the associated documentation.

This detailed explanation clarifies the system call implementation in the MVM.
The system call handler is a central point where user programs interact with the kernel.
It's a key element in the design of your virtual machine.
Each system call is responsible for managing any necessary resources,
interacting with virtual devices, and performing necessary actions.
Return values are always stored on the stack, which is managed by the VM's runtime environment.

# Informational Register Table

These registers hold status information and flags. They are not directly manipulated by most instructions, but
instructions may set their values based on the result of an operation.

| Register | Symbol | Name                     | Implemented | Description                                                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                 |

## Notes

- **Resetting Flags:** Many flags are automatically reset after an operation that might modify them. This prevents the
  flags from interfering with later operations.
- **Error Handling:** `I6` (ENSF) and `I7` (ESF) are essential parts of your error handling mechanism. Use them to
  indicate that an error has occurred. You can check their values to perform fault handling in the program.

# MVM Data Types

The Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) supports several fundamental data types. These types are used in instructions, system
calls, and within the standard library functions. The MVM uses a 64-bit architecture, but some instructions and
functions can operate on smaller data types as specified by the `SETTYPE` instruction. All values are stored in memory
as 64-bit Longs unless otherwise specified. The data type stored in the registers is tracked by using the `RegisterData`
class which you can change at any time using the `SETTYPE` instruction. If an instruction or system call that operates
on a smaller data type is used, but the register is a larger type, then the value will be truncated to fit that type.

## Fundamental Data Types

### Integer Types

| Type    | Size (bits) | Range                                                   | Notes                                                                |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Byte`  | 8           | -128 to 127                                             | Signed 8-bit integer.                                                |
| `Short` | 16          | -32,768 to 32,767                                       | Signed 16-bit integer.                                               |
| `Int`   | 32          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         | Signed 32-bit integer.                                               |
| `Long`  | 64          | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | Signed 64-bit integer.  This is the default data type for registers. |

### Floating-Point Types

| Type     | Size (bits) | Notes                                              |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Float`  | 32          | Single-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). |
| `Double` | 64          | Double-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754). |

### String Type

Strings are represented as null-terminated sequences of characters in memory. Each character occupies one word (64
bits).

### Boolean Type

Boolean values are represented using 64-bit Longs. The integer value of 0 represents false, and 1 represents true.

## Register Data Types

The `SETTYPE` instruction allows you to change the data type stored in a register at runtime. This allows for flexible
use of memory by being able to change data types as needed.

| Data Type | Description                                                                             | Size (bits) | Example                                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Byte`    | 8-bit signed integer                                                                    | 8           | `settype G1 Byte`                                   |
| `Short`   | 16-bit signed integer                                                                   | 16          | `settype G1 Short`                                  |
| `Int`     | 32-bit signed integer                                                                   | 32          | `settype G1 Int`                                    |
| `Long`    | 64-bit signed integer (default for registers).                                          | 64          | `settype G1 Long` (default)                         |
| `Float`   | 32-bit single-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754).                               | 32          | `settype X1 Float`                                  |
| `Double`  | 64-bit double-precision floating-point number (IEEE 754).                               | 64          | `settype X1 Double`                                 |

## Memory Representation

All values are stored in memory as 64-bit Longs regardless of the data type. This is to ensure consistency throughout
the memory. You can use smaller data types in registers, but memory always works with 64-bit Longs.

This document describes the data types used within the MVM. It's essential to understand these types when writing
assembly code for the MVM.

# MVM Standard Library Overview

The MVM standard library provides reusable functions to enhance MVM programs. These functions handle common tasks and offer higher-level abstractions.  All functions use the stack for arguments and return values.  The library is organised into modules, each focusing on a specific area of functionality.

## Library Modules

The standard library is structured into the following modules:

### String Functions

This module provides string manipulation functions. Functions operate on null-terminated strings, and memory management is handled automatically.  The available functions are:

- `strcmp`: Compares two strings lexicographically. Returns 1 if equal, 0 otherwise.
- `strcat`: Concatenates two strings.  Returns the address of the new string.
- `strcpy`: Copies a string from a source to a destination. Returns the destination address.
- `strlen`: Returns the length of a string.


### Array Functions

This module provides array-related functions. The functions support array creation, access, and manipulation. Arrays created with `createArray` can be cleared using `clean.array`.  The available functions are:

- `create`: Creates a new array. Returns the address of the new array.
- `get`: Gets an element from an array. Returns the element's value.
- `size`: Returns the size of an array.

### Math Functions

This module contains standard mathematical functions. For floating-point functions, operands must be of the same type.  The functions are:

- `min`: Returns the smaller of two values.
- `max`: Returns the larger of two values.
- `inc`: Increments a value by 1.
- `dec`: Decrements a value by 1.
- `neg`: Negates a value.
- `sq`: Squares a value.


### Clean Functions

This module handles clearing parts of memory automatically. The functions are

- `array`: Clears an array.
- `string`: Clears a string.

### IO Functions

This module handles simple I/O operations, including console input and output.  The functions are:

- `println`: Prints a string to the console with a newline.
- `readln`: Reads a line of input from standard input and returns its address.


### System Functions

This module is responsible for system-related functions The functions are

- `exit`: Exits the program


### Conversion Functions

This module contains data type conversion functions.  The available functions are:

- `asciiToInt`: Converts an ASCII character to its integer representation.
- `strtoint`: Converts a string to a, long.
- `findFirstString`: Finds the first occurrence of a character within a string.



## Calling Standard Library Functions

Standard library functions are called using the `CALL` instruction:

```assembly
call strings.strlen  // Call the strlen function
```

Arguments are passed in F registers (F1, F2, etc.), and the return value (if any) is pushed onto the stack.


## Further Information

Refer to the [Standard Library Table](Standard-Library-Table) for detailed information on each function, including argument types and return values.

# MVM Instruction Set

This document details the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) instruction set. Instructions are categorised for clarity. The MVM
uses a 64-bit architecture, and all instructions are 64 bits wide unless otherwise specified. Multi-word instructions
use two words. The MVM uses a stack-based architecture for function calls and return values.

## Data Transfer Instructions

These instructions move data between registers and memory.

### LIT

**`lit` `Destination Register` `Value` (Long Literal)**

Loads a 64-bit integer literal `Value` into the `Destination` register

```assembly
lit `G1` `10`       // G1 = 10
```

### XLIT

**`xlit` `Destination Register` `Value` (Double/Float Literal)**

Loads a floating-point literal `Value` into the `Destination` register. The data type (Float or Double) is determined at
runtime based on the data type assigned to the register by the `SETTYPE` instruction.

```assembly
xlit `X1` `3.14159` // X1 = 3.14159 (as a Double)
```

To load as a single-precision Float:

```assembly
settype `X1` `Float` // Set X1's data type to Float
xlit `X1` `3.14159` // X1 = 3.14159 (as a Float)
```

### MOV

**`mov` `Source Register` `Destination Register` (Register Value)**

Moves a value from the `Source` register to the `Destination` register.

```assembly

# MVM Process Management

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel manages the creation, execution, and termination of processes.
Processes run concurrently within the VM's emulated environment, using cooperative multitasking.
The kernel uses a round-robin scheduler.

## Process States

A process in the MVM can be in one of the following states:

- **RUNNING:** The process is currently executing instructions.
- **CANCELLED:** The process has terminated by another process.
- **PAUSED:** The process is paused by another process.

## Process Control Block (KProcess)

The kernel represents each process using a `KProcess` object.
This object acts as the process control block (PCB), storing all essential information about the process:

- **`id`:**  A unique integer identifier for the process.  (Assigned when a process is created).
- **`vm`:** An instance of the `Vm` class, representing the VM's state for this process.
  Each process gets its own VM
  object.
- **`file`:** A `File` object, the path to the program that the process runs.
- **`instructionMemory`:** A list of `InstructData` objects that represent the instructions in the program.
- **`ipcPermissions`:** A list of mailbox IDs for inter-process communication (IPC) that this process has access to.
- **`parent`:** The ID of the process's parent process (or `null` for the initial process).
- **`thread`:** The Kotlin `Thread` that executes instructions for the process.

This data is stored and managed by the kernel.

## Process Creation (`fork` and `spawn`)

The kernel provides two system calls for creating processes:

- **`fork()`:** Creates a new process, a copy of the current process.
  The child process has its own memory space,
  registers, and stack, but it starts with the same code as the parent.
  returns the child process's PID to
  the parent process and 0 to the child process.
  The `thread` is determined by the VM itself.
  The process is initialised at runtime in `KProcess.init`
- **`spawn(programPath.kar)`:** Creates a new process under the VM using the assembly code, using the file specified by `programPath.kar`.
  It will not inherit the
  state of the parent process.
  The process is added to the scheduler's ready queue.

## Process Termination (`HALT`)

HALT is added by the OS automatically and is inaccessible to the programmer.
A process terminates by calling the `HALT` key word.
The kernel will remove the process from the scheduler's ready queue.
This is different from the exit system call which exits the entire VM, working on a fix.



## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Inter-process communication is managed through mailboxes.
Each process has a list of mailbox IDs (`ipcPermissions`) which it has access to.
The OS manages mailboxes.
Processes communicate by sending (`send`) and receiving (`receive`) messages.
Processes can establish connections with other processes using the `link` system call.

This document provides an overview of process management in the MVM. For detailed information about the `KProcess` class
and system calls,

# MVM Kernel Scheduler

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel uses a scheduler to manage the concurrent execution of multiple processes.
The scheduler employs a round-robin algorithm,
allocating a single instruction cycle to each process before switching to the next.
This approach prioritises simplicity and reliability over complex scheduling strategies.

## Round-Robin Scheduling

The round-robin algorithm is a simple and efficient scheduling technique, particularly well-suited to the MVM's design.
Each process in the ready queue is given a single instruction cycle to execute.
After the instruction completes, the scheduler selects the next process from the ready queue,
effectively creating a circular order of execution.

## Scheduler Data Structures

The scheduler uses the following data structures:

- **Ready Queue:** A queue (`LinkedList`) containing the PIDs of processes ready to run. Processes are added to the ready queue when they are created or become ready after being blocked.
- **Running Process:** A variable to store the PID of the currently running process.


## Scheduler Algorithm

The scheduler's algorithm is straightforward.
Its function (`eventLoop`) iterates through a list of processes (`keepPcs`),
executing a single instruction per process in a round-robin fashion:

1. **Get Next Process:** Retrieve the next process from the ready queue (using `getNextProcess()`).
2. **Load Process State:** Load the process's state (registers, program counter, etc.) from its PCB (`KProcess`).
3. **Execute Instruction:** Execute a single instruction.
4. **Save Process State:** Save the process's state back into the PCB using the kernels `snapShotManager`.
5. **Add to Ready Queue (if not finished):** Add the process to the back of the ready queue, unless the process has ended.

This is repeated until all processes in `keepPcs` are finished.

## Handling Process Termination

When a process terminates (e.g., by executing the `exit` system call or completing its instructions),
the scheduler removes it from the ready queue.

## Integration with the Kernel

The scheduler is integrated into the kernel (`os/OS.kt`).
The kernel is responsible for managing process creation, termination, and other tasks related to process management.
The scheduler runs continuously to ensure processes are able to execute their instructions.

## Limitations of Round-Robin

This scheduling model does not prioritise certain processes or consider their CPU usage.
It also does not support preemption, and processes are limited to executing a single instruction at a time.
A long-running process that does not perform system calls will not give up the processor.

# MVM Virtual Devices

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) supports virtual devices that provide an interface between user-space programs and the
operating system (kernel). These devices are implemented as drivers within the kernel and are accessed via system calls.

## Virtual File System (VFS)

**Keynote!!!**
This is only in a specific branch in [vfs-v2](https://github.com/ChippyPlus/micro-vm/tree/vfs-v2).
And all of these features aren’t yet available in master


The virtual file system (VFS) is a crucial virtual device, providing file system functionality within the MVM. The VFS
is implemented as a driver within the kernel (`os/drivers/VFS.kt`). It handles file and directory operations. The VFS is
persistent, using a file (`vfs.fs`) to save and load its state. System calls provide access to the VFS.

The VFS supports:

- **File Creation:**  Creating new files using `newFile`.
- **File Deletion:** Deleting files and directories using `deleteFile`.
- **Reading Files:** Reading data from files into memory (`readFile`).
- **Writing Files:** Writing data from memory to files (`writeFile`).
- **Listing Files:** Listing files within directories (`listFiles`).
- **Directory Creation:**  Creating directories using `newDir`.

### VFS Data Structures

The VFS uses the following data structures:

- **`Ventry`:** A generic entry (file or directory) in the VFS. It contains the file/directory name, content (if a
  file), permissions, metadata (size, creation time), and a list of child `Ventry` objects (if it's a directory).
- **`Permissions`:** This structure defines the access permissions for a VFS entry (read, write).
- **`Meta`:** Contains metadata for a file or directory.

### VFS System Calls


The VFS is accessed using the following system calls:

- `newFile`: Creates a new file.
- `readFile`: Reads data from a file.
- `writeFile`: Writes data to a file.
- `deleteFile`: Deletes a file or directory.
- `listFiles`: Lists files and directories.
- `newDir`: Creates a new directory.

The function arguments, return values, and error handling for the VFS system calls are documented in
the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table).

## Other Virtual Devices

In addition to the VFS, the MVM kernel supports several other virtual devices, providing various functionalities within
the VM's emulated environment.
These devices are implemented as drivers in Kotlin:

### Console I/O

The console I/O driver provides system calls for interacting with a virtual console or terminal:

- `writeIo`: Writes data to the console.
- `readIo`: Reads input from the console.

### Timer

The MVM's scheduler uses a timer (not implemented as a virtual device) that counts instruction cycles. The timer doesn’t
have any system calls. Instead, the timer's counter is incremented after every instruction's execution. This counter
triggers a context switch once it reaches the maximum value set in the configuration file.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

The kernel manages IPC using mailboxes.
These are implemented using stacks (`os_package.Ipc.MessagePassing.mailBoxes`).
The following system calls provide access to the IPC:

- `link`: Establishes a link (connection) between two processes.
- `send`: Sends a message to another process.
- `receive`: Receives a message from another process.

This document provides an overview of virtual devices in the MVM. For more detailed information, refer to
the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table) and the specific documentation for each virtual device.

## Getting Started with MVM

This guide helps you set up and run the Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) to execute assembly code.  This guide is for macOS and Linux systems.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** MVM is written in Kotlin, which requires a JDK. Ensure you have JDK 17 or later installed.  You can download it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ChippyPlus/micro-vm.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd micro-vm
   ```

### Building the Project

1. **Execute with Gradle:** This builds the project and creates the executable JAR file.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Running Assembly Code

You can run your MVM assembly code (`.kar` files) using the following methods:

**Method 1: Using Gradle (Recommended for Development)**

1. **Execute with Gradle:** This runs the MVM from the JAR file, executing a `.kar` file provided as an argument.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew r --args="irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>"
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_assembly_file.kar>` with the path to your assembly file. For example:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew r --args="irun src/main/resources/programs/helloworld.kar"
   ```

**Method 2: Using the Executable JAR**

1. **Locate the JAR:** After building the project, find the JAR file (`MVM-1.0.jar` or similar) in the `build/libs/` directory.
2. **Run with Java:**
   ```bash
   java -jar build/libs/MVM-1.0.jar irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>
   ```

**Method 3: Using an Alias**

1. **Create an alias:** This creates a shell alias to simplify running the MVM.
   ```bash
   alias mvm="java -jar build/libs/MVM-1.0.jar"
   ```
2. **Run with the alias:**
   ```bash
   mvm irun <path_to_assembly_file.kar>
   ```

### Clean Up

If you do not plan to build the project again, it's recommended to remove the Gradle cache files:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.gradle
```

### Example

Here's a simple MVM assembly program (`myprogram.kar`):

```assembly
// Example HelloWorld program 

STR F1 "Hello, World!"   // Load string into memory and returns pointer to F1
call println             // Prints the string located in F1 to stdout

```

To run this program, use one of the above commands, replacing `<path_to_assembly_file.kar>` with `myprogram.kar`. The output will be printed to the console.

Now you can start writing and executing your own assembly programs. Refer to the [Instruction Table](Instruction-Table) for a list of instructions and their syntax.

# Micro Virtual Machine (MVM)

**A Kotlin-based Educational Virtual Machine**

This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for the Micro Virtual Machine (MVM) project, an educational virtual machine designed to explore the fundamentals of operating system and virtual machine architecture.

## Project Overview

The MVM project aims to create a flexible and extensible virtual machine implemented in Kotlin.  It serves as a platform for learning and experimenting with low-level programming concepts within a higher-level language environment.  This rewrite focuses on simulating a time-sharing operating system kernel within the virtual machine.

## Key Features

* **Custom Assembly Language:** The virtual machine uses a straightforward assembly language for writing programs. Instructions support data movement, arithmetic, stack operations, control flow, memory access, and system calls.
* **Dynamic Register Sizing:** Registers can have their data type changed at runtime, providing flexibility and memory efficiency.
* **Multi-Process Support:** The virtual machine can run multiple programs concurrently as distinct processes, simulating a time-sharing OS on a single (emulated) core.
* **Virtual File System (VFS):** A virtual file system enables programs to interact with files and directories within the VM.
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Provides mechanisms (message passing) for processes to communicate with each other.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The virtual machine uses a dedicated set of Intel registers to manage error conditions.  This provides informative error messages and the ability to handle errors gracefully, without halting the entire system.
* **Extensible Design:** The modular design of the project makes it easier to add new features, instructions, and standard library functions.


## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the virtual machine, please refer to the [Installation and Setup](Getting-Started) guide.


## Explore the Documentation

The MVM's documentation is organised to guide you from basic concepts to more advanced topics.  Please consult the sidebar for quick navigation.  The documentation is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for the project's design and implementation details.

# MVM Kernel Overview

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) kernel is a time-sharing kernel designed for educational purposes.
It manages multiple processes concurrently within the VM's emulated environment.
The kernel is implemented in Kotlin and runs separately from the VM's user-space processes;
user programs interact with the kernel via system calls.
The kernel itself does not reside in the VM's emulated memory.

## Key Kernel Components

The MVM kernel comprises the following key components:

### Scheduler

The scheduler manages the execution of processes,
allocating a single instruction cycle to each process before switching.
The MVM kernel uses a round-robin scheduler.
The scheduler maintains a ready queue of processes waiting for execution.
The scheduler is invoked after each instruction completes execution.

### Process Manager

This component is responsible for creating, managing, and terminating processes. Key data structures include:

- **Process Control Block (PCB):** Represented by the `KProcess`(Kernel Active Process) class, this data structure
  stores information about each process (PID, registers, memory, state, etc.).
- **System Calls:** The kernel provides system calls for process creation (`fork`, `spawn`), termination (`exit`), and
  other process-related operations.

### Snap Shot Manager

The snapshot manager keeps track of the state of each process at any given time during execution.
When the kernel switches between processes, it snapshots the state the active process and saved it in memory.
This includes

* Registers
* Memory
* Pc

### Virtual File System (VFS)

The VFS driver manages file system operations within the VM
and is responsible for implementing a set of system calls for file operations.
The VFS is persistent, saving and loading data from the `vfs.fs` file.

### Virtual Devices

The kernel includes drivers for virtual devices:

- **Console I/O:** Provides system calls for console input (`readIo`) and output (`writeIo`).
- **Timer:** The timer is not emulated as a virtual device.
  Instead, the scheduler is driven by a counter that
  increments after each instruction cycle.
  This is private to the VM itself

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

The kernel manages IPC between processes using message passing mailboxes.

### System Call Handler

This component intercepts system calls from user-space programs, dispatching them to the appropriate kernel functions.

## Execution Model

The MVM uses a round-robin scheduling model.
Each process receives a single instruction before the scheduler switches to another process.
Processes do not block on system calls; they execute one instruction at a time.
This design prioritises reliability and simplicity when handling many concurrent processes.

This document gives a high-level overview of the MVM kernel.

# Plans & Enhancements

## I. Language and Runtime Enhancements

1. **Customizable Syntax:** Allow users to define their own syntax for MVM assembly language, enabling domain-specific languages or personalized coding styles.
2. **Built-in Data Structures:** Implement built-in support for more complex data structures like hash maps, trees, and graphs, accessible through standard library functions or new instructions.
3. **Type Inference:** Add type inference to your higher-level language (if you create one), reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
4. **Automatic Memory Management:**  Explore garbage collection algorithms (mark-and-sweep, reference counting) to automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.
5. **Reflection API:** Allow programs running in the VM to inspect and manipulate their own structure and behavior (e.g., access register values, inspect the call stack).
6. **Dynamic Linking:** Enable dynamic linking of libraries or modules, allowing programs to load and use external code at runtime.

## II.  Virtualisation and System-Level Features

7. **Nested Virtualisation:** Allow running a VM *inside* your MVM!  (Requires careful resource management).
8. **Hardware Emulation (Beyond Simple Devices):** Emulate more complex hardware, like a simplified GPU, sound card, or network card with packet routing capabilities.
9. **Virtual Machine Introspection:** Provide tools or system calls that allow VM programs to inspect and modify the VM's state.
10. **Snapshots and Checkpointing:** Enable saving and restoring the complete VM state or creating checkpoints during program execution for debugging and fault tolerance.
11. **Process Migration:** Allow migrating running processes between different instances of your MVM (if you have multiple VMs running).
12. **System Call Sandboxing:** Implement security mechanisms to restrict system call access for untrusted programs.

## III.  Concurrency and Parallelism

13. **User-Level Threads:** Implement user-level threads within the VM, managed by a user-space thread library.
14. **Multicore Support:** Extend the VM to support multiple emulated cores, enabling true parallelism.  (Requires a more sophisticated scheduler.)
15. **Asynchronous I/O:** Implement asynchronous I/O operations for virtual devices, allowing processes to continue execution while waiting for I/O to complete.
16. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Instructions:** Add SIMD instructions to perform parallel operations on vectors of data.

## IV.  Debugging and Development Tools

17. **Time-Travel Debugging:** Implement a debugger that allows stepping backward through program execution to analyze program behavior.
18. **Code Coverage Analysis:** Add tools to measure code coverage during testing.
19. **Performance Profiler:** Develop tools to profile CPU usage, memory access patterns, and other performance metrics.
20. **Bytecode Disassembler:** Create a tool to disassemble MVM bytecode back into assembly language for easier analysis.

## V. Advanced VM Features

21. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Compile frequently executed bytecode into native machine code for performance gains (challenging, as it's architecture-specific).
22. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler:** Compile MVM bytecode into native executables for specific platforms.
23. **Garbage Collection:** Implement garbage collection algorithms to automate memory management.
24. **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Allow MVM programs to call functions written in other languages (e.g., C/C++).
25. **Bytecode Verification:** Add bytecode verification to ensure that loaded programs are well-formed and don't violate security policies.

## VI. Random Ideas

26. **Non-Deterministic Execution:** Implement instructions with probabilistic outcomes, creating a non-deterministic execution environment (interesting for simulations or genetic algorithms).
27. **MVM as a Service:** Create a web service that allows users to upload and run MVM programs remotely.


This document details planned enhancements for the MVM. This is a high-level view, and the prioritization and specifics are subject to change.

# Introduction to MVM Assembly Language

This page provides a gentle introduction to the MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) assembly language. MVM assembly is a
low-level language designed for a simple, time-sharing virtual machine. It allows you to write programs by providing a
set of instructions that manipulate data stored in registers and memory. The virtual machine manages multiple processes
concurrently.

## Basic Concepts

* **Registers:** The MVM uses several types of registers:
	* **General Purpose Registers (G1-G10):** Used for general computations and data storage.
	* **System Registers (S1-S4):** Used for passing arguments to system calls.  `S1` holds the system call ID.
	* **Return Registers (R1-R10):** Used to store the results of operations and system calls.
	* **Function Argument Registers (F1-F10):** Used for passing arguments to functions.
	* **Floating-Point Registers (X1-X10):** Used for floating-point arithmetic.
	* **Intel Registers (I1-I10):** Hold status flags and other information.
* **Memory:** The MVM has a fixed amount of memory, accessed using addresses. Each address holds a 64-bit integer.
* **Stack:** A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure for temporary storage. Used for function calls return values.
* **Instructions:** Instructions specify operations. Each instruction has a mnemonic (e.g., `ADD`, `MOV`) and
  arguments (operands).
* **System Calls:** Functions to interact with the operating system (OS plus Kernel), such as file I/O, process
  management, and more. These are invoked using the `SYSCALL` instruction, which takes the system call ID as an
  argument.

## Example Program

This simple program adds two numbers and prints the result:

```assembly
LIT G1 10      // Load 10 into G1
LIT G2 5       // Load 5 into G2
ADD G1 G2 R1   // Add G1 and G2; result in R4
PRINTR R1      // Print the value in R4 (15)
```

## Key Instruction Categories

* **Data Transfer:** `LIT`, `XLIT`, `MOV`, `STORE`, `LOAD`, `PUSH`, `POP`, `PEEK`, `CPY`, `SETTYPE`, `DEALLOC`
* **Arithmetic:** `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `MOD`, `POW`,
* **Bitwise:** `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `SHL`, `SHR`
* **XFloats:** `XADD`, `XSUB`, `XMUL`, `XDIV`, `XMOD`, `XPOW`, `ITOF`,    `FTOI`
* **Control Flow:** `JMP`, `JZ`, `JNZ`, `CALL`, `RET`
* **String:** `STR`
* **I/O:** `PRINTS`, `PRINTR`
* **System Calls:** `SYSCALL`
* **Miscellaneous:** `INR`, `HELP`, `SLEEP`

# ASCII Table

## Notes

* **ASCII control characters (character code 0–31)** The first 32 characters in the `ASCII-table` are unprintable
  control codes and are
  used to
  control peripherals such as printers
* **ASCII printable characters (character code 32–127)** Codes 32–127 are common for all the different variations of the
  ASCII table, they are called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few
  miscellaneous symbols. You will find almost every character on your keyboard. Character 127 represents the command
  DEL.

# MVM Registers

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) uses registers to store data actively being processed.
Registers provide fast access to data during program execution. The MVM uses several types of registers, each serving a
specific purpose. All registers are 64 bits wide unless otherwise noted.

## Register Types

### General Purpose Registers (G1-G10)

These registers are used for general computations, data storage, and calculations. They can be used as operands in all
instructions.

```assembly
lit G1 10       // Load the literal value 10 into register G1
```

### System Registers (S1-S4)

These registers are used for system calls. `S1` holds the system call ID; `S2`, `S3`, and `S4` pass arguments to the
system call.

```assembly
lit S1 24            // Load system call 24 (writeIo) into S1
mov G1 S2            // Pass string address to S2
syscall              // Make system call
```

### Return Registers (R1-R10)

These registers typically hold the results of operations (arithmetic, comparison, bitwise) and system calls

- `R1` is usually returned by standard library operations
- `R2` is conventionally used for system call return values.
- `R3` typically holds results from bitwise operations.
- `R4` conventionally holds results from arithmetic, comparison, and string operations.
- `R5` conventionally holds results from floating-point operations. Note `R5` By default is a FLOAT Register type so
  this
  is recommended.
- `R6` conventionally holds results from `INR` instructions.

```assembly
add G1 G2 R4   // Result of addition is in R4
```

### Function Argument Registers (F1-F10)

These registers are used exclusively for passing arguments to functions (subroutines). Arguments are placed in these
registers **before** the function call.

```assembly
lit F1 10           // Load argument 1 into F1
call maths.sq       // Call the square function
prints              // Print the result on the stack, 100. 10 * 10 
```

### Floating-Point Registers (X1-X10)

These registers are used for floating-point arithmetic operations. By defult these are Floats. Not Doubles

```assembly
xlit X1 3.14159 //  Load a floating-point literal

### Intel Registers (I1-I10)

These registers hold status flags and other metadata. They are set implicitly by various instructions and are not
directly modified by most instructions.

- `I1`  Set if the last operation resulted in zero.
- `I2`  Set if the last arithmetic operation's result was negative.
- `I3`  Set according to the last `GT` or `LT` comparison.
- `I4`  Set if the last `EQ` comparison was true.
- `I5`  Indicates system call success.
- `I6`  Indicates a general error.
- `I7`  Holds a code specifying the error type.
- `I8`  Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
- `I9`  Set when a signal is received.
- `I10` Stores the ID for inter-process communication.

see for more information -> [Informational Registers](Informational-Registers)

## Register Size

All registers are 64 bits wide, capable of storing 64-bit integer values, or a floating point number of any type,
depending on the register data type assigned using the `SETTYPE` instruction.
The options are BYTE, SHORT, INT, LONG, FLOAT, and DOUBLE.



## Register Access

Registers are accessed by name (e.g., `G1`, `S2`, `R4`, `X1`, `I8`) in MVM assembly instructions.

## Register Initialization

Registers are initialised to 0 when a process is created.

## Example: Function Call

```assembly
lit F1 5         // Load argument 1 into F1
lit F2 1         // Load argument 2 into F2
call test        // Call the test function
pop R1           // Get the return value from the stack
```

## Memory vs. Registers

Registers offer faster access than memory. Store frequently accessed data in registers. Use memory for larger data
structures or data not requiring constant access. `STORE` and `LOAD` instructions transfer data between registers and
memory.

Refer to the [Instruction Set](Instruction-Set) documentation for more examples of register usage.

# MVM System Calls Overview

System calls provide a mechanism for MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) programs to request services from the operating system
(kernel).
All system calls use the stack for arguments and return values.
The system call ID is passed in register `S1`.

## System Call Categories

The system calls are categorised for clarity:

### File System Calls

These system calls interact with the virtual file system (VFS):

- `newFile`: Creates a new file.
- `readFile`: Reads data from a file.
- `writeFile`: Writes data to a file.
- `deleteFile`: Deletes a file or directory.


### Process Management Calls
**Very UNSTABLE!**

These system calls manage processes within the MVM:

- `exec`: Executes a new program from the host operating system.
- `fork`: Creates a child process (a copy of the current process).
- `spawn`: Creates a new process and runs a program file.
- `exit`: Terminates the current process.
- `getpid`: Gets the process ID of the current process.
- `getuid`: Gets the user ID of the current process.
- `handleSignals`: Registers a signal handler for the process.
- `sendSignal`: Sends a signal to another process.
- `pause_t`: Pauses a specified process.
- `continue_t`: Resumes a paused process.


### IPC Calls
**Very UNSTABLE!**
These system calls provide inter-process communication (IPC):

- `share_m`: Establishes a shared memory region between two processes.
- `send`: Sends a message to another process using message passing.
- `receive`: Receives a message from another process.


### Host OS Calls

These system calls interact with the host operating system:
- `time`: Gets the current system time.



### Other System Calls

These system calls provide other miscellaneous functionality:

- `writeIo`: Writes a null-terminated string to standard output.
- `readIo`: Reads a line from standard input.
- `createArray`: Creates a new array.
- `arraySet`: Sets an array element.
- `arrayGet`: Gets an array element.


## Making System Calls

System calls are invoked using the `syscall` instruction.
The system call ID (`SystemCallID`) is in register `S1`.
Arguments are passed in `S2`, `S3`, and `S4`.
Return values (if any) are stored in `R2`


```assembly
lit S1 14        // Load system call ID 14 (time) into S1
syscall              // Make the system call
```

## Further Information

For a detailed list of system calls, their arguments, return values,
and notes, refer to the [System Call Table](System-Calls-Table).
This overview explains the purpose and organisation of the MVM system calls.

# MVM Memory Model

The MVM (Micro Virtual Machine) uses a linear memory model with a fixed size.  All memory locations are directly addressable using 64-bit addresses. The MVM's memory is a single contiguous block.

## Memory Addressing

The MVM uses direct addressing. The operand of a memory access instruction (`LOAD`, `STORE`) specifies the memory address directly.  These are *physical addresses* within the VM's single memory block. There is no virtual addressing or memory segmentation in this model.

The MVM performs boundary checks when accessing memory.  Attempting to read from or write to a memory address outside the allocated range for the current process will raise an exception. 

```assembly
lit G1 100       // Value to store
lit G2 50        // Memory address 
store G1 G2      // Store 100 at address 50

## String Storage

Strings are stored as null-terminated arrays of 64-bit words. Each word holds one character (ASCII). The null terminator (value 0) marks the end of the string.  Memory for strings is allocated dynamically.

```assembly
str G1 "Hello"   ; Store "Hello"; G1 contains string's starting address
```
This looks like `104 | 101 | 108 | 108 | 111 | 0 ` in memory

## Array Storage

Arrays are stored contiguously in memory. The first word contains the array's size (number of elements). Subsequent words hold array elements.  The data type of array elements is specified during array creation using the `createArray` system call.


```assembly
// Create array of size 10, Longs
lit S1 26      // Array Create
lit S2 10       // Size of 10
syscall        // Result: Array base address in R2

// Store value 50 at index 0
lit S1 27       // Array Set
mov R2 S2 		// Move Array to S2
lit S3 0		// Index 0
lit S4 50		// Value 50
syscall         // arraySet
```

This document explains the MVM's linear memory model, how memory is addressed, and how strings and arrays are stored. The MVM uses direct addressing and allocates memory for strings dynamically.
